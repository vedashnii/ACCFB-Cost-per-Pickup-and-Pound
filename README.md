# Food Recovery Cost Assessment for CA SB 1383
Our project seeks to determine the true operational cost of food recovery. This code can be used to estimate the cost per pickup and cost per pound of food collected under California’s SB 1383 food recovery requirements. The analysis uses address information, travel distances, and fuel costs to understand how transportation affects the overall cost of food recovery operations. The results will inform funding decisions and policy advocacy under SB 1383.

### Contents of this Repository
This repository contains a skeleton code in a Jupyter Notebook to calculate Cost-per-Pickup and Pound for Food Recovery Organizations from Salesforce report data. The sheet used in the original was a Salesforce report 
detailing Pickup Data for a year across various Food Recovery Organizations.

Your sheet should include the columns, Food Recovery Program Name, Food Donor Addresses, Food Recovery Program Addresses, and Amount of Food Picked Up. Each row should correspond to a pickup.
